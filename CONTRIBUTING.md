# Contributing to Chantal

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Chantal!

## Project Status

**⚠️ Chantal is currently in the Research & Design phase.**

We're not ready for code contributions yet, but there are other valuable ways to contribute right now.

## How to Contribute (Current Phase)

### 1. Share Your Experience

Have you worked with repository mirroring tools? We'd love to hear about:

- **Production experience** with apt-mirror, aptly, reposync, bandersnatch, or devpi
- **Pain points** you've encountered
- **Scale challenges** (repo size, package count, bandwidth)
- **Use cases** we might not have considered

**How:** Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/yourusername/chantal/discussions) in the "Experience Reports" category.

### 2. Review Design Documents

We're making architectural decisions right now. Your input is valuable:

- Read [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) for full requirements
- Check [.planning/findings.md](.planning/findings.md) for our tool analysis
- Review [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for our roadmap

**How:** Comment on open issues tagged with `architecture` or `design`.

### 3. Suggest Improvements

Have ideas about:
- CLI design?
- Configuration format?
- Plugin architecture?
- Storage strategy?

**How:** Open an issue with the `enhancement` label.

### 4. Report Issues with Existing Tools

Found bugs or limitations in apt-mirror, aptly, reposync, etc. that Chantal should avoid?

**How:** Open an issue with the `research` label.

## Future Contribution Guidelines

Once we move to the implementation phase (Phase 4+), we'll be accepting:

- Code contributions (Python)
- Documentation improvements
- Test cases
- Plugin implementations

We'll update this guide when we reach that stage.

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: Questions, ideas, experience sharing
- **Email**: simon@lauger.de for private/security matters

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and professional. We're all here to build something useful.

Detailed Code of Conduct coming soon.

## License
